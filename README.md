# crypto-signals

The statement of our project, is the
following: find signals to predict the movement of the crypto-currency market. Our analysis was
based on 50 signals and 139 different coins. All the signals we have analyzed are from technical
analysis and our study takes into account the historical data of the corners since 2019, with data
at a daily frequency. Once this analysis was done, we had to find a way to combine all these
signals together in order to create a single signal.
